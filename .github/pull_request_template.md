Important steps for creating and reviewing a pull request (PR):

**Creator make sure that:**

1. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `feature/` or `fix/` prefixes. Good examples are: `feature/amazing-new-feature-1337` or `fix/name-of-issue-1338`.

2. Check if your last commit has a :heavy_check_mark: (CircleCI could run tests without errors)

3. Your pull request should target the `development` branch on this repository. (Only after a sprint review or when a new set of features is ready, choosing `master` is allowed!)

4. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

5. Add all implemented features and/or fixed bugs.

6. Optional: Add important information for the reviewers and/or images if necessary.

7. Select at least one other team member as reviewer, assign yourself or your representative as Assignee.

8. Optional: Select the current milestone and link the issues for this PR.

Creator is done!

**Review process:**

1. Checkout this branch.

2. Run the application and check if the issue was fixed or the feature works as expected (check acceptance criteria).

3. Submit feedback if anything doesn't work or is missing.

4. If the bugs were fixed or all acceptance criteria are fullfilled approve this pull request.

5. Select "Squash and merge" to finish the review process.

Reviewer is done, too!
